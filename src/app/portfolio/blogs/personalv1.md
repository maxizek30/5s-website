# Personal Website Journey

Creating my personal website has always been something I've wanted to do, though I can't pinpoint exactly why. It just feels cool to have a space of my own to showcase my work—like a modern-day business card.

From the start, I knew I didn’t want to rely on UI libraries or CSS frameworks like Tailwind. Instead, I saw this as a chance to dive deeper into learning raw CSS and improving my skills.

While looking for inspiration, I came across some incredibly creative personal websites—like [this](https://bruno-simon.com/) one with a 3D car game and [another](https://dustinbrett.com/) styled as a desktop. At first, these designs got me really excited, but they also made me feel nervous and unmotivated, thinking, “How could I ever compete with these?”

Eventually, I realized that simplicity can be just as effective. While those intricate designs are impressive, my goal was to make it easy for visitors to navigate and see my projects, so I opted for a clean, minimalistic approach.

I started by sketching out my design in Figma (which you can find [here](https://www.figma.com/design/Jy1sdaMEjKB19m5r51a74L/Personal-Website-Wireframes?m=auto&t=cgDc4XZebZuDXReC-1)) and even created a mobile-friendly version to streamline development. Choosing a color scheme was tricky, but I ended up borrowing colors from one of my favorite games, Valorant. I wanted the site to feel like a single-page app, which is why I went with a layout that includes black bars around the edges—giving it a unique, standout look.

For development, I chose Vite as the build tool, which turned out to be an awesome decision as the project progressed.
