## Bite Battle - Project Overview

**Bite Battle** is an interactive app designed to help users decide where to eat in a fun, gamified way. The app generates a 24-restaurant bracket using the **Yelp Fusion API** based on the user's location. Users choose between two restaurants in each round until only one winner remains.

### Tech Stack:

- **React** for the frontend
- **Express** for the backend (handling API requests to Yelp)
- **React Router** for navigation
- **PICO CSS** for minimal styling
- **Netlify** for frontend hosting

This project was a fun challenge in integrating API data and creating an intuitive UI with smooth transitions between rounds. I deployed the frontend on Netlify, and Iâ€™m considering deploying the backend next.
