# Personal Website

This personal website was created in the summer of 2024 as part of the **PLU 5s program**, a PLU initiative where participants are paired with a group to develop a project and receive guidance from an industry titan. Prior to this, I already had a personal website, but I decided to update it because I wasn't satisfied with its appearance. You can find the previous version [here](https://maxlopezpersonalsite.netlify.app/).

I wanted something fresh, with more engaging effects and a more cohesive color palette. While I liked the layout of my old site, I opted to retain that structure while enhancing the overall design. I began by creating the design in Figma(Which you can find [here](https://www.figma.com/design/Jy1sdaMEjKB19m5r51a74L/Personal-Website-Wireframes?m=auto&t=cgDc4XZebZuDXReC-1)), and from there, I implemented it using **Next.js**, a tool I grew to enjoy for its intuitive file-based routing.

After building the basic screens, I revisited the individual project screens and decided the old layout needed a refresh. I switched to a **bento UI layout**, which allows you to view all project details in a single view without scrolling. It's a unique way to showcase projects, although images and long descriptions can occasionally get cut off depending on the aspect ratio. Despite that, Iâ€™m happy with the final outcome.

I completed the site by adding some basic animations for smooth navigation, an animated grainy texture, and a subtle glow effect when hovering over project items.

Special thanks to **Noel Sigafoos** for answering all my questions and keeping me on track throughout this project.
